## Background
This project originated from the need to optimize personal daily viewing experience. As a movie enthusiast, I use the combination of 115 Network Disk + CloudDrive2 + Emby to manage and watch media content.

Imagine this scenario:

While commuting, you come across an interesting movie. Simply send the magnet link to the TG bot, and it will:
- Automatically download the movie to the specified category directory in 115 Network Disk
- Intelligently clean up advertisement files
- Automatically create STRM files and notify Emby for media library scanning

When you return home after work, just prepare some snacks and drinks, open Emby, and enjoy a well-organized viewing experience. Let a good movie wash away your daily fatigue and help you relax.

## Known Issues
- Limited support for TV series. Downloading series directly may cause unexpected issues
- Directory synchronization will clear the entire folder, including metadata (quite aggressive)

## Usage Guide

### Basic Commands

- `/start`   - Show help information
- `/auth`    - 115 authorization setup
- `/reload`  - reload the configuration
- `/rl`      - Retry list
- `/av`      - AV number download
- `/sync`    - Sync directory and create symlinks
- `/sm`      - Subscribe to movies
- `/q`       - Cancel current session

### 115 Open Platform Application

**Strongly recommend applying for 115 Open Platform for better user experience**
- Application URL: [115 Open Platform](https://open.115.com/)
- After approval, fill in the `115_app_id` in the configuration file

If you don't want to use the 115 Open Platform, please use the previous image version `qiqiandfei/115-bot:v2.3.7`

### Video Download Configuration

Due to Telegram Bot API limitations, videos larger than 20MB cannot be downloaded. To download large videos, please configure the Telegram client:

#### Configuration
Telegram API application address: [Telegram Development Platform](https://my.telegram.org/auth)

When your application is successful, you will receive a “tg_api_id” and “tg_api_hash”.

Ensure that these three parameters are correct:
```
# bot_name
bot_name: "@yourbotname"

# telegram api info
tg_api_id: 1122334
tg_api_hash: 1yh3j4k9dsk0fj3jdufnwrhf62j1k33f
```

> **Note**: If you don't configure this step, the bot will still work normally, but cannot handle video files larger than 20MB.

### Important Warning

⚠️ **Synchronization Function Warning**: The `/sync` command will **delete all files in the target directory**, including metadata. Large-scale synchronization operations may trigger 115 Network Disk's risk control mechanism, please use with caution!
