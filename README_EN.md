## Background
This project originated from the need to optimize personal daily viewing experience. As a movie enthusiast, I use the combination of 115 Network Disk + CloudDrive2 + Emby to manage and watch media content.

Imagine this scenario:

While commuting, you come across an interesting movie. Simply send the magnet link to the TG bot, and it will:
- Automatically download the movie to the specified category directory in 115 Network Disk
- Intelligently clean up advertisement files
- Automatically create STRM files and notify Emby for media library scanning

When you return home after work, just prepare some snacks and drinks, open Emby, and enjoy a well-organized viewing experience. Let a good movie wash away your daily fatigue and help you relax.

## Known Issues
- Limited support for TV series. Downloading series directly may cause unexpected issues
- Directory synchronization will clear the entire folder, including metadata (quite aggressive)

## Usage Guide

### Basic Commands

- `/start`   - Show help information
- `/cookie`  - Set 115 Cookie
- `/dl`      - Add offline download
- `/sync`    - Sync directory and create symlinks (will delete all files in current directory, use with caution!)
- `/sm`      - Subscribe to movies
- `/q`       - Cancel current session

### 115 Open Platform Application

It's recommended to apply for the 115 Open Platform for a better experience. Application URL: [115 Open Platform](https://open.115.com/)
After approval, fill in the 115_app_id in the configuration file.

If you don't want to use the 115 Open Platform, please use the previous image version: qiqiandfei/115-bot:v2.3.7

### Video Download Instructions

Due to Telegram bot API limitations, videos larger than 20MB cannot be downloaded. Therefore, if you need video download functionality, you need to use the Telegram client.

Steps to get Telegram client session file:
  - 1. Log in to Telegram platform and create a personal app application [https://my.telegram.org/auth](https://my.telegram.org/auth)
  - 2. Get app_id and app_hash
  - 3. Fill in the id and hash obtained in step 2 into the create_tg_session_file.py script
  - 4. Execute the create_tg_session_file script to get the "user_session.session" file
  - 5. Put "user_session.session" in the config directory and mount it to the container

If you don't perform this step, it won't affect the 115-bot operation, you just won't be able to download video files larger than 20MB.
